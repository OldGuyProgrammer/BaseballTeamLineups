### How to use this progeam
<p>Baseball fans typically like to keep box scores of games. We do too. Fans would buy a game card or box score card and fill in player information by hand. For Major League games, rosters and line-ups are published ahead of time and change very little from game to game, except for the starting pitcher.</p>
<p>For minor league games, college, little league and other leagues, the line-ups might not be known until right before game time.</p>
<p>This program is designed to make it easier to for fans to set up their score cards.</p>
<p>Fans can enter team names and player names long before game time. Then at game time, this program makes it easier to create line-ups right before game time.</p>
<ul>
Any time before game time, fans can:
<li>Enter team information</li>
<li>Enter player information</li>
<li>Update any needed statistics for teams and players.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players are assigned to teams when the line-ups are entered.</p>
